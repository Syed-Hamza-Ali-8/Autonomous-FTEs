## 📊 Clean Graph View Ready

Your Obsidian graph is now organized and minimal:

**Structure:**
```
bronze/
├── Dashboard.md          ← You are here (hub)
├── Done/                 ← 6 demo files + metadata
│   ├── Team_Meeting_2026-01-13.md
│   ├── Project_Status_Report.txt
│   ├── Technical_Architecture.md
│   ├── meeting_notes.txt
│   ├── project_kickoff.txt
│   └── weekly_report.md
└── Docs/                 ← Documentation (hidden from graph)
    ├── README.md
    ├── OBSIDIAN_SETUP.md
    ├── QUICK_START_GUIDE.md
    └── Company_Handbook.md
```

**Graph View:** 10 nodes total
- 1 Dashboard (central hub)
- 6 original files in Done/
- 3 metadata files with summaries

**To view your clean graph:**
1. Open Obsidian
2. Open `bronze/` folder as vault
3. Press `Ctrl+G` for graph view
4. See Dashboard connected to all processed files via wikilinks
