Every year, software teams are told to chase the next big thing. New tools. New frameworks. New promises. Most of them don’t survive contact with real work. In 2025, a few patterns held up in practice. Teams kept using them as deadlines tightened, complexity grew, and real trade-offs had to be made. Let’s explore the ideas that actually shaped how teams built last year and why they still matter as we head into 2026. 👇 Idea #1: Focus less on the tools and more on how they fit together 🧩 With new features dropping every week, it’s easy to get lost in the noise. Over time, teams gravitate toward setups that reduce friction across their workflow, even as new features keep shipping. This is why Model Context Protocol (MCP) gained so much traction last year and will only continue to pick up steam going forward. MCP is an open standard that helps AI systems interact with tools in consistent, transparent ways. Rather than adding yet another abstraction, it provides a clearer mental model for building AI tooling that’s designed to last. Here’s how to extend GitHub Copilot coding agent with MCP in a single repository: Configure Copilot’s coding agent to use MCP-powered tools. Give it scoped access to issues, pull requests, security findings, and workflows. Assign it a real task, for example: From there, Copilot can investigate the codebase, reason across context, and open a pull request, all without custom glue code or brittle integrations. (Tip: start with read-only tools and explicitly allowlist what you want Copilot to access.) ❗Why this matters: MCP is the “plumbing” that helps AI tooling stay reliable as systems grow and evolve, because it connects agents to real tools and real context in a consistent way. This is just a quick look at the mechanics. Listen to our MCP podcast to dig into the trade-offs, real-world use cases, and where this approach works best in practice.  👉 Idea #2: Build small things that solve real problems 🛠️ Many useful tools start small, with a narrow goal and a clear problem to solve. One of the strongest throughlines this year was the rise of small, purpose-built tools, often created by individuals or small teams to solve a very specific problem well. Open source and AI have lowered the barrier to building, making it easier to go from idea to working software without stripping away creativity or craftsmanship. Here’s how you can build something small yet meaningful without committing to a full product:  Create a new repository (public or private). Add a simple README.md describing the problem you’re solving. 3. Create a branch called first-solution. 4. Add a small script, config file, or workflow yourself that solves one specific problem. 5. Open a pull request and merge it. That’s it. No roadmap. No scaling plan. Just a focused solution that works. ❗Why this matters: This kind of small, intentional build is often how durable ideas start. It’s easier to understand, easier to maintain, and easier to improve over time. But this is only the quick version. Check out our DIY development podcast to discover why this works and where it breaks down. 👉 Idea #3: Let values shape the software you ship 🌱 Some of the most resilient projects aren’t defined by speed or scale, but by the values they protect. Over the past year, a consistent theme emerged: sustainability shows up in everyday choices—privacy, governance, documentation, and how welcoming a project is to contributors. These decisions shape whether software earns trust and continues to deserve it. Here’s a lightweight way to make values visible in a project you already have: Open an existing repository. Add or improve: A clear README.md (what this is, who it’s for, and what it won’t do). A CONTRIBUTING.md (how people can help, even without writing code). A SECURITY.md (how to responsibly report issues). Depending on your project: A CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md (set expectations for community behavior) A SUPPORT.md (where users should ask questions) A FUNDING.yml (ways to financially support the project) 3. Open a pull request explaining why these files matter. No new features. No refactors. Just clarity. ❗Why this matters: Projects last longer when people understand how to use them, how to contribute, and what they stand for. Curious how these principles show up at scale? Listen in as maintainers and builders break down how they apply them in open source and privacy-first projects. 👉 The bottom line  As 2026 approaches, it’s worth paying attention to what continues to hold up in day-to-day work. The patterns above—how tools fit together, why small builds still matter, and how values shape software—kept shaping real work in 2025 and are likely to continue. Carry those forward. Build with more clarity and intention, and let the rest fall away. Found these ideas helpful?
