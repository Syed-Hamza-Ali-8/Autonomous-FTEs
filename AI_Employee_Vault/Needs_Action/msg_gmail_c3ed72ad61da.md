Trend Watch: OpenAI launches Developer App Store Submissions

Following its announcement of [Apps for OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/introducing-apps-in-chatgpt/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_campaign=August-2025) at DevDay, the company has officially opened [submissions for developer apps](https://openai.com/index/developers-can-now-submit-apps-to-chatgpt/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_campaign=August-2025) on ChatGPT. Using the OpenAPI App SDK, you can finally create an application and add it to the [official directory](https://chatgpt.com/apps?utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_campaign=August-2025) for distribution. Currently available apps include Canva, Instacart, Spotify, Adobe Photoshop, and Expedia.

If you have an idea and want to [submit an app](https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk/app-submission-guidelines?utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_campaign=August-2025), here’s what you need to know:

- Design your tool with an obvious purpose, such as helping users find hotel deals, place grocery orders, or update slide decks.
- Ensure your app is predictable and reliable, provides accurate information, and has undergone thorough testing to prove it won’t crash or lag.
- Use a name that makes it easy for users to understand the app’s purpose and features.

You can build these apps using the [Model Context Protocol](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/model-context-protocol?utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_campaign=August-2025) and descriptive tool annotations, making it easy for OpenAI evaluators to understand how your application works and provide straightforward information to users.

Currently, these applications are designed to support ChatGPT and OpenAI workflows for physical goods only, excluding digital commodities and subscriptions, which limits potential opportunities for developers. They also cannot include advertising or promote specific products. Some might find this curious, given that users have noticed in-chat suggestions for app suggestions that [resembled advertisements](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/openai-slammed-for-app-suggestions-that-looked-like-ads/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_campaign=August-2025), even for those with paid subscriptions.

This directory could be a real boon for developers who want to get their apps off the ground with a powerful SDK and monetization options.

The first of these developer-submitted applications won’t start rolling out until the new year. Which makes the timing ideal if you’d like to use the holidays to reset, relax with family and friends, while also diving into some [vibe coding](https://www.digitalocean.com/resources/articles/vibe-coding-tools?utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_campaign=August-2025&utm_source=marketo&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=ai-newsletter-dec-2nd&utm_content=vibe-coding-tools) before submitting your idea.

AI Books of Note

Online resources offer the most up-to-date information about building with AI, but longer-form books provide the opportunity to delve deeper.

Here are our recommended AI reads for December:

- [Co-Intelligence: Living and Working with AI](https://www.amazon.com/Agentic-Design-Patterns-Hands-Intelligent-ebook/dp/B0FH1RQSWP?utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_campaign=August-2025) offers thoughtful commentary on navigating this new technology from Wharton professor Ethan Mollick.

Notably, all author royalties are being donated to charity.
- [Patterns for Building AI Agents](https://www.amazon.com/Patterns-Building-Agents-Sam-Bhagwat/dp/B0FXF5T79G/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_campaign=August-2025) by Sam Bhagwat and Michelle Gienow is a short and practical guidebook, now available as a follow-up to the now-viral [Principles of Building AI Agents](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Building-Agents-Sam-Bhagwat/dp/B0DYH5GHDD?utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_campaign=August-2025). Limited free copies are available by filling out the form on [Mastra’s website](https://mastra.ai/book?utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_campaign=August-2025).

Models on our radar

- [Z-Image-Turbo](https://huggingface.co/Tongyi-MAI/Z-Image-Turbo?utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_campaign=August-2025): The latest and greatest image generation model, Z-Image-Turbo is an incredibly powerful and efficient model at just 6b parameters. It boasts competitive capabilities with SOTA closed-source image generation tools at a fraction of the computational cost
- [VibeVoice Realtime 0.5B](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/VibeVoice-Realtime-0.5B?utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_campaign=August-2025): a lightweight real‑time text-to-speech model supporting streaming text input and robust long-form speech generation. It can be used to build real-time TTS services, narrate live data streams, and let different LLMs start speaking from their very first tokens long before a full answer is generated. It produces initial audible speech in ~300 ms on an NVIDIA H200.
- [GLM-TTS](https://huggingface.co/zai-org/GLM-TTS?utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_campaign=August-2025): GLM-TTS is a high-quality text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis system based on large language models, supporting zero-shot voice cloning and streaming inference. The system adopts a two-stage architecture combining an LLM for speech token generation and a Flow Matching model for waveform synthesis.
- [GLM-4.6V](https://huggingface.co/zai-org/GLM-4.6V?utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_campaign=August-2025) and [GLM-4.6V-Flash](https://huggingface.co/zai-org/GLM-4.6V-Flash?utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_campaign=August-2025): GLM-4.6V series model includes two versions: GLM-4.6V (106B), a foundation model designed for cloud and high-performance cluster scenarios, and GLM-4.6V-Flash (9B), a lightweight model optimized for local deployment and low-latency applications. GLM-4.6V scales its context window to 128k tokens in training, and achieves SoTA performance in visual understanding among models of similar parameter scales. Crucially, they integrate native Function Calling capabilities for the first time. This effectively bridges the gap between "visual perception" and "executable action" providing a unified technical foundation for multimodal agents in real-world business scenarios.

Community and technical tutorials

- LLM latency can tank your user experience, especially in time-sensitive apps like phone bots. This hands-on tutorial shows you how to build [parallel agentic workflows](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-build-parallel-agentic-workflows-with-python?utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_campaign=August-2025&utm_source=marketo&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=ai-newsletter-dec-2nd&utm_content=parallel-agentic-workflows) that fire off multiple LLM calls simultaneously using Python's asyncio and aiohttp, slashing response times from 3-15 seconds down to sub-second.
- Ever wondered how to make neural networks understand relationships instead of just data points? [Graphic neural networks](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/graph-neural-networks-fundamentals?utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_campaign=August-2025&utm_source=marketo&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=ai-newsletter-dec-2nd&utm_content=graph-neural-networks) (GNNs) learn from the connections between nodes—think social networks, molecular structures, or recommendation systems—using message-passing to propagate information across graphs. The tutorial walks through building one in PyTorch Geometric with the classic Cora citation dataset.
- Pandas hits its limits once you're dealing with tens of millions of rows, but you don't have to spin up Spark or Dask. [DuckDB lets you run](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/duckdb-complements-pandas-for-large-scale-analytics?utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_campaign=August-2025&utm_source=marketo&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=ai-newsletter-dec-2nd&utm_content=duckdb-pandas-analytics) SQL directly against Parquet files and pandas DataFrames in the same query, handling larger-than-memory datasets with columnar storage and multi-threaded execution—all from a single pip install.
- GitHub Copilot launched the AI coding assistant era in 2021, but the space has since expanded with numerous options. This roundup breaks down [10 GitHub Copilot alternatives](https://www.digitalocean.com/resources/articles/github-copilot-alternatives?utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_campaign=August-2025&utm_source=marketo&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=ai-newsletter-dec-2nd&utm_content=github-copilot-alternatives)—from OpenAI Codex and Claude Code to open-source picks like Tabby—comparing their IDE integrations, privacy controls, and pricing tiers so you can find the right fit.
- Google's Gemini and OpenAI's ChatGPT have carved out distinct niches—one deeply woven into Google Workspace with real-time search grounding, the other excelling at creative reasoning and custom GPTs. We compare [ChatGPT vs. Gemini](https://www.digitalocean.com/resources/articles/gemini-vs-chatgpt?utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_campaign=August-2025&utm_source=marketo&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=ai-newsletter-dec-2nd&utm_content=chatgpt-vs-gemini), including their pricing, multimodal capabilities, and when to choose one over the other based on what you're actually trying to accomplish.
