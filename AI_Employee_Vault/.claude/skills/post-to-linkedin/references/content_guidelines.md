# LinkedIn Content Guidelines

This document provides guidelines for creating engaging, professional LinkedIn content that generates sales leads.

## Content Principles

### 1. Value-First Approach

**Focus on providing value**, not just promoting:
- ✅ Share insights and lessons learned
- ✅ Offer actionable tips and advice
- ✅ Ask thought-provoking questions
- ❌ Don't just promote products/services
- ❌ Avoid hard sales pitches

**Example - Good**:
```
💡 Key insight from this week: workflow optimization

Automation isn't about replacing humans—it's about empowering
them to focus on what matters most.

What's your take on AI-powered business automation?

#AI #BusinessGrowth #Productivity
```

**Example - Bad**:
```
🚨 BUY NOW! Our automation software is 50% off!

Limited time offer! Click here to purchase!

#Sale #Discount #BuyNow
```

### 2. Professional Tone

**Maintain professionalism** while being approachable:
- ✅ Use professional language
- ✅ Be authentic and genuine
- ✅ Show personality (appropriate emojis)
- ❌ Avoid slang or overly casual language
- ❌ Don't use excessive emojis

**Tone spectrum**:
```
Too Formal          Ideal              Too Casual
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
"We are pleased    "Excited to share   "OMG guys check
to announce..."    our progress..."    this out!!!"
```

### 3. Engagement-Focused

**Encourage interaction** to boost visibility:
- ✅ Ask questions
- ✅ Invite comments and discussion
- ✅ Use calls-to-action (CTA)
- ✅ Tag relevant people (sparingly)
- ❌ Don't beg for likes/shares

**Effective CTAs**:
- "What's your take on [topic]?"
- "Interested in learning more? Let's connect!"
- "Share your experience in the comments"
- "DM me to discuss [topic]"

## Content Structure

### Post Format

**Recommended structure**:
```
[Hook/Opening] (1 line)

[Body/Value] (2-3 sentences)

[Call-to-Action] (1 line)

[Hashtags] (3-5 relevant tags)
```

**Character limits**:
- Optimal: 150-300 characters
- Maximum: 3,000 characters
- Hashtags: 3-5 (more looks spammy)

### Hook Examples

**Attention-grabbing openings**:
- 🚀 "Excited to share..."
- 💡 "Key insight from this week..."
- 📊 "Quick update on..."
- 🎯 "Here's what we learned..."
- ✨ "Proud to announce..."

**Avoid**:
- ❌ "Hello everyone..."
- ❌ "Just wanted to say..."
- ❌ "Check out this..."

### Body Content

**Value delivery**:
- Share specific insights or data
- Tell a brief story
- Provide actionable advice
- Highlight achievements with context

**Example - Specific**:
```
We've streamlined our communication workflows and reduced
manual tasks by 70%. The key? Intelligent automation that
handles routine work while humans focus on strategy.
```

**Example - Vague** (avoid):
```
We're doing great things with automation. It's really
helping our business. You should try it too.
```

### Call-to-Action

**Effective CTAs**:
- "Interested in learning more? Let's connect!"
- "What's your experience with [topic]?"
- "DM me to discuss how we can help"
- "Share your thoughts in the comments"

**Avoid**:
- ❌ "Click the link in bio"
- ❌ "Buy now!"
- ❌ "Follow for more"

## Hashtag Strategy

### Hashtag Selection

**Use 3-5 relevant hashtags**:
- 1-2 broad industry tags (#AI, #Business)
- 1-2 specific topic tags (#Automation, #Productivity)
- 1 niche/branded tag (#WorkflowOptimization)

**Example combinations**:
```
Topic: AI Automation
Hashtags: #AI #Automation #BusinessGrowth #Productivity

Topic: Sales Automation
Hashtags: #Sales #Automation #CRM #Efficiency

Topic: Digital Transformation
Hashtags: #DigitalTransformation #Innovation #Technology
```

### Hashtag Best Practices

**Do**:
- ✅ Use relevant, popular hashtags
- ✅ Mix broad and specific tags
- ✅ Research trending hashtags in your industry
- ✅ Place hashtags at the end of post

**Don't**:
- ❌ Use more than 5 hashtags
