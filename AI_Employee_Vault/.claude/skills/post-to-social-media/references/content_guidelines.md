### The Hook-Value-CTA Structure

```
[HOOK] - Attention-grabbing opening (emoji, question, bold statement)
↓
[VALUE] - 2-3 sentences providing insight, tip, or story
↓
[CTA] - Clear call to action (comment, share, click, DM)
↓
[HASHTAGS] - Relevant hashtags for discovery
```

### Example:

```
🚀 [HOOK] Most businesses waste 15+ hours per week on repetitive tasks.

[VALUE] We analyzed 100+ companies and found that email management,
data entry, and scheduling consume the most time. The solution?
Smart automation that learns your workflow.
